Hi!

Let me show how the sensor connects to the PC as well as the software
setup needed in order for the entire connectivity to work. This post may come
off as image-heavy so here goes.

## Hardware

(image taken from the [ADXL345 Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/adxl345-hookup-guide))

This is the **ADXL345** sensor on a breakout board.

The **Diolan DLN-2**. This is an [adapter](https://diolan.com/dln-2) that allows USB connectivity to I2C/SPI/GPIO/PWM/ADC.
Using this adapter, we'll be able send and receive data to/from I2C slave devices. In this
case, the ADXL345 serves as the [slave](http://www.i2c-bus.org/slave/).

![Connection diagram](http://i.imgur.com/avaqQ1W.png)

In order to establish connectivity between the DLN-2 and the ADXL345, we must follow the
diagram above from the datasheet.

The ribbon connector of the DLN-2 for I2C connectivity is well-labeled thus, connection
is as simple as attaching the IC hook and alligator clip to their corresponding pins
on the sensor[^1][^2]. However, the ADXL345's connectivity is not as simple so I placed it on the
breadboard and wired it according to the connection diagram above.

**Important Notes:**

  * **DLN-2:** Set the I2C VCC to 3.3V by moving the jumper to the corresponding setting.
  * **DLN-2:** Removed the jumper on the I2C's SDA and SCL pull-up resistors since I'm wiring
    external pull-up resistors on the breadboard.
  * **Breadboard:** I wired the sensor as shown above and made use of *4.7 kilo-ohm* resistors[^3].
    Exposed some wires where I hooked and clip the ribbon connector of the DLN-2.
  * **Breadboard:** ALT ADDRESS is the SDO pin on the sensor. I *grounded* it as per the diagram
    above. This in turn would mean we'll use *0x53* as the I2C slave address.

## Software

Daniel, one of my mentors, provided a ready to use [QEMU](http://qemu-project.org/Main_Page) setup
for testing and debugging of the module. The use of virtual machine gives me the benefit where I
don't have to reboot my PC when something goes wrong thus, interrupting my workflow.

In the kernel configuration, have the **CONFIG_[GPIO/I2C/MFD/SPI]_DLN2** built-in (select 'y') and
also the drivers of my network/wireless cards so that I have connectivity in the
*guest* kernel.

Plugging the USB cable attached to the Diolan to the PC and launching QEMU will give this output:
{% highlight shell %}

That's it! Thanks for reading.
