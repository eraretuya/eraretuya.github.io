Hello there! The posts leading to this one have demonstrated how to write a
basic IIO driver. I was able to carry out the [planned features](https://eraretuya.github.io/2016/12/29/writing-a-driver-for-adxl345/) including the *scale*.

I submitted the driver last January 25. You can follow the submission details [here](https://marc.info/?l=linux-iio&m=148533644407371&w=2) including the review and other feedbacks. The **v2** follow-up and eventual acceptance can be read [here](https://marc.info/?l=linux-iio&m=148584711012686&w=2).

I'm happy and relieved to get this driver [accepted](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/jic23/iio.git/commit/?h=testing&id=c62360753e469a4cc5f4629c4ccb090985b33d6e).
Currently, I'm working on the other missing features for the remainder of the internship.

I will be posting about those features soon. Stay tuned and thanks for reading!
